  ABSTRACT = {Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94\% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86\% with a minor isoform frequency of 15\% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

  ABSTRACT = {Complex and intricate RNA splicing mechanisms are crucial for gene regulation and for maximizing proteomic diversity. This Review discusses how alterations to splicing mechanisms --- such as mutations in pre-mRNAs, or mutations and dysregulation of core spliceosome proteins and other RNA-binding proteins --- results in diverse molecular consequences and various diseases. Opportunities for therapeutic correction of these defects are also explored. The human transcriptome is composed of a vast RNA population that undergoes further diversification by splicing. Detecting specific splice sites in this large sequence pool is the responsibility of the major and minor spliceosomes in collaboration with numerous splicing factors. This complexity makes splicing susceptible to sequence polymorphisms and deleterious mutations. Indeed, RNA mis-splicing underlies a growing number of human diseases with substantial societal consequences. Here, we provide an overview of RNA splicing mechanisms followed by a discussion of disease-associated errors, with an emphasis on recently described mutations that have provided new insights into splicing regulation. We also discuss emerging strategies for splicing-modulating therapy.},

  ABSTRACT = {To illuminate the extent and roles of exonic sequences in the splicing of human RNA transcripts, we conducted saturation mutagenesis of a 51-nt internal exon in a three-exon minigene. All possible single and tandem dinucleotide substitutions were surveyed. Using high-throughput genetics, 5560 minigene molecules were assayed for splicing in human HEK293 cells. Up to 70\% of mutations produced substantial (greater than twofold) phenotypes of either increased or decreased splicing. Of all predicted secondary structural elements, only a single 15-nt stem-loop showed a strong correlation with splicing, acting negatively. The in vitro formation of exon-protein complexes between the mutant molecules and proteins associated with spliceosome formation (U2AF35, U2AF65, U1A, and U1-70K) correlated with splicing efficiencies, suggesting exon definition as the step affected by most mutations. The measured relative binding affinities of dozens of human RNA binding protein domains as reported in the CISBP-RNA database were found to correlate either positively or negatively with splicing efficiency, more than could fit on the 51-nt test exon simultaneously. The large number of these functional protein binding correlations point to a dynamic and heterogeneous population of pre-mRNA molecules, each responding to a particular collection of binding proteins.},

Here, we present a >95\% complete local landscape for a defined molecular function---the alternative splicing of a human exon (FAS/CD95 exon 6, involved in the control of apoptosis). The landscape provides important mechanistic insights, revealing that regulatory information is dispersed throughout nearly every nucleotide in an exon, that the exon is more robust to the effects of mutations than its immediate neighbours in genotype space, and that high mutation sensitivity (evolvability) will drive the rapid divergence of alternative splicing between species unless it is constrained by selection. Moreover, the extensive epistasis in the landscape predicts that exonic regulatory sequences may diverge between species even when exon inclusion levels are functionally important and conserved by selection. Genotype--phenotype landscapes are an important characteristic for understanding the evolution of traits. Here the authors construct the local landscape for the alternative splicing of FAS/CD95 exon 6, revealing the regulation of splicing and the evolution of regulatory information between species.},

  ABSTRACT = {Following CART-19 immunotherapy for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), many patients relapse due to loss of the cognate CD19 epitope. Since epitope loss can be caused by aberrant CD19 exon 2 processing, we herein investigate the regulatory code that controls CD19 splicing. We combine high-throughput mutagenesis with mathematical modelling to quantitatively disentangle the effects of all mutations in the region comprising CD19 exons 1-3. Thereupon, we identify ~200 single point mutations that alter CD19 splicing and thus could predispose B-ALL patients to developing CART-19 resistance. Furthermore, we report almost 100 previously unknown splice isoforms that emerge from cryptic splice sites and likely encode non-functional CD19 proteins. We further identify cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins that control CD19 splicing (e.g., PTBP1 and SF3B4) and validate that loss of these factors leads to pervasive CD19 mis-splicing. Our dataset represents a comprehensive resource for identifying predictive biomarkers for CART-19 therapy. Multiple alternative splicing events in CD19 mRNA have been associated with resistance/relapse to CD19 CAR-T therapy in patients with B cell malignancies. Here, by combining patient data and a high-throughput mutagenesis screen, the authors identify single point mutations and RNA-binding proteins that can control CD19 splicing and be associated with CD19 CAR-T therapy resistance.},

@ARTICLE{Schirman2021-ss,
  ABSTRACT = {RNA splicing is a key process in eukaryotic gene expression, in which an intron is spliced out of a pre-mRNA molecule to eventually produce a mature mRNA. Most intron-containing genes are constitutively spliced, hence efficient splicing of an intron is crucial for efficient regulation of gene expression. Here we use a large synthetic oligo library of ~20,000 variants to explore how different intronic sequence features affect splicing efficiency and mRNA expression levels in S. cerevisiae. Introns are defined by three functional sites, the 5' donor site, the branch site, and the 3' acceptor site. Using a combinatorial design of synthetic introns, we demonstrate how non-consensus splice site sequences in each of these sites affect splicing efficiency. We then show that S. cerevisiae splicing machinery tends to select alternative 3' splice sites downstream of the original site, and we suggest that this tendency created a selective pressure, leading to the avoidance of cryptic splice site motifs near introns' 3' ends. We further use natural intronic sequences from other yeast species, whose splicing machineries have diverged to various extents, to show how intron architectures in the various species have been adapted to the organism's splicing machinery. We suggest that the observed tendency for cryptic splicing is a result of a loss of a specific splicing factor, U2AF1. Lastly, we show that synthetic sequences containing two introns give rise to alternative RNA isoforms in S. cerevisiae, demonstrating that merely a synthetic fusion of two introns might be suffice to facilitate alternative splicing in yeast. Our study reveals novel mechanisms by which introns are shaped in evolution to allow cells to regulate their transcriptome. In addition, it provides a valuable resource to study the regulation of constitutive and alternative splicing in a model organism.},

The multitude of regulatory inputs to splicing limits the potential to infer general principles from investigating native sequences. Here, we create a rationally designed library of >32,000 splicing events to dissect the complexity of splicing regulation through systematic sequence alterations. Measuring RNA and protein splice isoforms allows us to investigate both cause and effect of splicing decisions, quantify diverse regulatory inputs and accurately predict (R2 = 0.73--0.85) isoform ratios from sequence and secondary structure. By profiling individual cells, we measure the cell-to-cell variability of splicing decisions and show that it can be encoded in the DNA and influenced by regulatory inputs, opening the door for a novel, single-cell perspective on splicing regulation. Alternative splicing is regulated by multiple mechanisms. Here the authors employed designed splice site libraries and massively parallel reporter assays to dissect the regulatory complexity and cell-to-cell variability of splicing decisions and to build accurate predictive models.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mutations causing aberrant splicing are frequently implicated in human diseases including cancer. Here, we establish a high-throughput screen of randomly mutated minigenes to decode the cis-regulatory landscape that determines alternative splicing of exon 11 in the proto-oncogene MST1R (RON). Mathematical modelling of splicing kinetics enables us to identify more than 1000 mutations affecting RON exon 11 skipping, which corresponds to the pathological isoform RON∆165. Importantly, the effects correlate with RON alternative splicing in cancer patients bearing the same mutations. Moreover, we highlight heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (HNRNPH) as a key regulator of RON splicing in healthy tissues and cancer. Using iCLIP and synergy analysis, we pinpoint the functionally most relevant HNRNPH binding sites and demonstrate how cooperative HNRNPH binding facilitates a splicing switch of RON exon 11. Our results thereby offer insights into splicing regulation and the impact of mutations on alternative splicing in cancer. Alternative splicing is a critical step in eukaryotic gene expression but its molecular rules are not fully understood. Here, the authors develop a high-throughput mutagenesis approach to comprehensively characterise determinants of alternative splicing for the RON proto-oncogene.},

  ABSTRACT = {Splicing-affecting mutations can disrupt gene function by altering the transcript assembly. To ascertain splicing dysregulation principles, we modified a minigene assay for the parallel high-throughput evaluation of different mutations by next-generation sequencing. In our model system, all exonic and six intronic positions of the SMN1 gene's exon 7 were mutated to all possible nucleotide variants, which amounted to 180 unique single-nucleotide mutants and 470 double mutants. The mutations resulted in a wide range of splicing aberrations. Exonic splicing-affecting mutations resulted either in substantial exon skipping, supposedly driven by predicted exonic splicing silencer or cryptic donor splice site (5'ss) and de novo 5'ss strengthening and use. On the other hand, a single disruption of exonic splicing enhancer was not sufficient to cause major exon skipping, suggesting these elements can be substituted during exon recognition. While disrupting the acceptor splice site led only to exon skipping, some 5'ss mutations potentiated the use of three different cryptic 5'ss. Generally, single mutations supporting cryptic 5'ss use displayed better pre-mRNA/U1 snRNA duplex stability and increased splicing regulatory element strength across the original 5'ss. Analyzing double mutants supported the predominating splicing regulatory elements' effect, but U1 snRNA binding could contribute to the global balance of splicing isoforms. Based on these findings, we suggest that creating a new splicing enhancer across the mutated 5'ss can be one of the main factors driving cryptic 5'ss use.},

  ABSTRACT = {Genetic analyses and systematic mutagenesis have revealed that synonymous, non-synonymous and intronic mutations frequently alter the inclusion levels of alternatively spliced exons, consistent with the concept that altered splicing might be a common mechanism by which mutations cause disease. However, most exons expressed in any cell are highly-included in mature mRNAs. Here, by performing deep mutagenesis of highly-included exons and by analysing the association between genome sequence variation and exon inclusion across the transcriptome, we report that mutations only very rarely alter the inclusion of highly-included exons. This is true for both exonic and intronic mutations as well as for perturbations in trans. Therefore, mutations that affect splicing are not evenly distributed across primary transcripts but are focussed in and around alternatively spliced exons with intermediate inclusion levels. These results provide a resource for prioritising synonymous and other variants as disease-causing mutations.},

  ABSTRACT = {Despite a wealth of molecular knowledge, quantitative laws for accurate prediction of biological phenomena remain rare. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is an important regulated step in gene expression frequently perturbed in human disease. To understand the combined effects of mutations during evolution, we quantified the effects of all possible combinations of exonic mutations accumulated during the emergence of an alternatively spliced human exon. This revealed that mutation effects scale non-monotonically with the inclusion level of an exon, with each mutation having maximum effect at a predictable intermediate inclusion level. This scaling is observed genome-wide for cis and trans perturbations of splicing, including for natural and disease-associated variants. Mathematical modeling suggests that competition between alternative splice sites is sufficient to cause this non-linearity in the genotype-phenotype map. Combining the global scaling law with specific pairwise interactions between neighboring mutations allows accurate prediction of the effects of complex genotype changes involving >10 mutations.},

Toward better modeling the sequence determinants of alternative splicing, we measured the splicing patterns of over two million (M) synthetic mini-genes, which include degenerate subsequences totaling over 100 M bases of variation. The massive size of these training data allowed us to improve upon current models of splicing, as well as to gain new mechanistic insights. Our results show that the vast majority of hexamer sequence motifs measurably influence splice site selection when positioned within alternative exons, with multiple motifs acting additively rather than cooperatively. Intriguingly, motifs that enhance (suppress) exon inclusion in alternative 5' splicing also enhance (suppress) exon inclusion in alternative 3' or cassette exon splicing, suggesting a universal mechanism for alternative exon recognition. Finally, our empirically trained models are highly predictive of the effects of naturally occurring variants on alternative splicing in vivo.},

  ABSTRACT = {Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step in the expression of most human genes. Mutations at the 5' splice site (5'ss) frequently cause defective splicing and disease due to interference with the initial recognition of the exon-intron boundary by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), a component of the spliceosome. Here, we use a massively parallel splicing assay (MPSA) in human cells to quantify the activity of all 32,768 unique 5'ss sequences (NNN/GYNNNN) in three different gene contexts. Our results reveal that although splicing efficiency is mostly governed by the 5'ss sequence, there are substantial differences in this efficiency across gene contexts. Among other uses, these MPSA measurements facilitate the prediction of 5'ss sequence variants that are likely to cause aberrant splicing. This approach provides a framework to assess potential pathogenic variants in the human genome and streamline the development of splicing-corrective therapies.},

  ABSTRACT = {OBJECTIVE: A well-known limit of genome browsers is that the large amount of genome and gene data is not organized in the form of a searchable database, hampering full management of numerical data and free calculations. Due to the continuous increase of data deposited in genomic repositories, their content revision and analysis is recommended. Using GeneBase, a software with a graphical interface able to import and elaborate National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene database entries, we provide tabulated spreadsheets updated to 2019 about human nuclear protein-coding gene data set ready to be used for any type of analysis about genes, transcripts and gene organization. RESULTS: Comparison with previous reports reveals substantial change in the number of known nuclear protein-coding genes (now 19,116), the protein-coding non-redundant transcriptome space [now 59,281,518 base pair (bp), 10.1\% increase], the number of exons (now 562,164, 36.2\% increase) due to a relevant increase of the RNA isoforms recorded. Other parameters such as gene, exon or intron mean and extreme length appear to have reached a stability that is unlikely to be substantially modified by human genome data updates, at least regarding protein-coding genes. Finally, we confirm that there are no human introns shorter than 30 bp.},

  ABSTRACT = {Alternative splicing performs a central role in expanding genomic coding capacity and proteomic diversity. However, programming of splicing patterns in engineered biological systems remains underused. Synthetic approaches thus far have predominantly focused on controlling expression of a single protein through alternative splicing. Here, we describe a modular and extensible platform for regulating four programmable exons that undergo a mutually exclusive alternative splicing event to generate multiple functionally-distinct proteins. We present an intron framework that enforces the mutual exclusivity of two internal exons and demonstrate a graded series of consensus sequence elements of varying strengths that set the ratio of two mutually exclusive isoforms. We apply this framework to program the DNA-binding domains of modular transcription factors to differentially control downstream gene activation. This splicing platform advances an approach for generating diverse isoforms and can ultimately be applied to program modular proteins and increase coding capacity of synthetic biological systems.},

  ABSTRACT = {Alternative splicing generates differing RNA isoforms that govern phenotypic complexity of eukaryotes. Its malfunction underlies many diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Comparative analysis of RNA isoforms at the genome-wide scale has been difficult. Here, we establish an experimental and computational pipeline that performs de novo transcript annotation and accurately quantifies transcript isoforms from cDNA sequences with a full-length isoform detection accuracy of 97.6\%. We generate a searchable, quantitative human transcriptome annotation with 31,025 known and 5,740 novel transcript isoforms ( http://steinmetzlab.embl.de/iBrowser/ ). By analyzing the isoforms in the presence of RNA Binding Motif Protein 20 (RBM20) mutations associated with aggressive dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), we identify 121 differentially expressed transcript isoforms in 107 cardiac genes. Our approach enables quantitative dissection of complex transcript architecture instead of mere identification of inclusion or exclusion of individual exons, as exemplified by the discovery of IMMT isoforms mis-spliced by RBM20 mutations. Thereby we achieve a path to direct differential expression testing independent of an existing annotation of transcript isoforms, providing more immediate biological interpretation and higher resolution transcriptome comparisons.},

  ABSTRACT = {Illumina-based synthetic long read RNA-seq enables comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing in transcriptomes. Alternative splicing shapes mammalian transcriptomes, with many RNA molecules undergoing multiple distant alternative splicing events. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis, including analysis of exon co-association in the same molecule, requires deep, long-read sequencing. Here we introduce an RNA sequencing method, synthetic long-read RNA sequencing (SLR-RNA-seq), in which small pools ($\leq$1,000 molecules/pool, $\leq$1 molecule/gene for most genes) of full-length cDNAs are amplified, fragmented and short-read-sequenced. We demonstrate that these RNA sequences reconstructed from the short reads from each of the pools are mostly close to full length and contain few insertion and deletion errors. We report many previously undescribed isoforms (human brain: ∼13,800 affected genes, 14.5\% of molecules; mouse brain ∼8,600 genes, 18\% of molecules) and up to 165 human distant molecularly associated exon pairs (dMAPs) and distant molecularly and mutually exclusive pairs (dMEPs). Of 16 associated pairs detected in the mouse brain, 9 are conserved in human. Our results indicate conserved mechanisms that can produce distant but phased features on transcript and proteome isoforms.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mutually exclusive splicing of exons is a mechanism of functional gene and protein diversification with pivotal roles in organismal development and diseases such as Timothy syndrome, cardiomyopathy and cancer in humans. In order to obtain a first genomewide estimate of the extent and biological role of mutually exclusive splicing in humans, we predicted and subsequently validated mutually exclusive exons (MXEs) using 515 publically available RNA-Seq datasets. Here, we provide evidence for the expression of over 855 MXEs, 42\% of which represent novel exons, increasing the annotated human mutually exclusive exome more than fivefold. The data provide strong evidence for the existence of large and multi-cluster MXEs in higher vertebrates and offer new insights into MXE evolution. More than 82\% of the MXE clusters are conserved in mammals, and five clusters have homologous clusters in Drosophila Finally, MXEs are significantly enriched in pathogenic mutations and their spatio-temporal expression might predict human disease pathology.},

  ABSTRACT = {Understanding transcriptome complexity is crucial for understanding human biology and disease. Technologies such as Synthetic long-read RNA sequencing (SLR-RNA-seq) delivered 5 million isoforms and allowed assessing splicing coordination. Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore increase throughput also but require high input amounts or amplification. Our new droplet-based method, sparse isoform sequencing (spISO-seq), sequences 100k-200k partitions of 10-200 molecules at a time, enabling analysis of 10-100 million RNA molecules. SpISO-seq requires less than 1 ng of input cDNA, limiting or removing the need for prior amplification with its associated biases. Adjusting the number of reads devoted to each molecule reduces sequencing lanes and cost, with little loss in detection power. The increased number of molecules expands our understanding of isoform complexity. In addition to confirming our previously published cases of splicing coordination (e.g., BIN1), the greater depth reveals many new cases, such as MAPT Coordination of internal exons is found to be extensive among protein coding genes: 23.5\%-59.3\% (95\% confidence interval) of highly expressed genes with distant alternative exons exhibit coordination, showcasing the need for long-read transcriptomics. However, coordination is less frequent for noncoding sequences, suggesting a larger role of splicing coordination in shaping proteins. Groups of genes with coordination are involved in protein-protein interactions with each other, raising the possibility that coordination facilitates complex formation and/or function. We also find new splicing coordination types, involving initial and terminal exons. Our results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the human transcriptome and a general, cost-effective method to analyze it.},

  ABSTRACT = {Drugs that target pre-mRNA splicing hold great therapeutic potential, but the quantitative understanding of how these drugs work is limited. Here we introduce a biophysical-modeling framework that can quantitatively describe the sequence-specific and concentration-dependent behavior of splice-modifying drugs. Using massively parallel splicing assays, RNA-seq experiments, and precision dose-response curves, we apply this framework to two small-molecule drugs, risdiplam and branaplam, developed for treating spinal muscular atrophy. The results quantitatively define the specificities of risdiplam and branaplam for 5' splice site sequences, suggest that branaplam recognizes 5' splice sites via two distinct interaction modes, and disprove the prevailing two-site hypothesis for risdiplam activity at SMN2 exon 7. The results also show, more generally, that single-drug cooperativity and multi-drug synergy are widespread among both small-molecule drugs and antisense-oligonucleotide drugs that promote exon inclusion. Our biophysical-modeling approach thus clarifies the mechanisms of existing splice-modifying treatments and provides a quantitative basis for the rational development of new therapies. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement ARK is: an inventor on issued nusinersen patents licensed by CSHL to Ionis Pharmaceuticals and Biogen; an inventor on an issued patent for familial dysautonomia ASOs; a co-founder, Director, Chair of the SAB, and shareholder of Stoke Pharmaceuticals; a paid consultant for Biogen; a collaborator of Ionis Pharmaceuticals; and a member of the SABs and shareholder of Skyhawk Pharmaceuticals, Envisagenics, and Autoimmunity BioSolutions.},

@ARTICLE{Christofk2008-bu,
  ABSTRACT = {Metabolic regulation in rapidly growing tissues such as fetal tissue and tumours tends to differ from that in most normal adult tissues, and many tumour cells are known to express the M2 (fetal) form of the glycolysis pathway enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2) rather than the adult M1 isoform. Two linked papers in this issue focus on role of PKM2 in tumour cells. In the first, PKM2 was identified in a proteomic screen as a phosphotyrosine binding protein. Replacement of endogenous PKM2 with a point mutant that cannot bind phosphotyrosine slows the growth of cancer cells in culture, indicating that regulation of PKM2 via phosphotyrosine binding is essential for cancer cell proliferation. In the second paper, PKM2 is shown to promote tumorigenesis and to switch cellular metabolism to increased lactate production and reduced oxygen consumption. This pattern resembles aspects of the Warburg effect, Otto Warburg's observation, made in the 1930s, that many cancer cells produce energy by glycolysis followed by lactic acid fermentation in the cytosol, rather than by mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate. Many tumour cells express the M2 form of pyruvate kinase rather than the usual M1 form. PKM2 is now shown to promote tumorigenesis and switch the cellular metabolism to increased lactate production and reduced oxygen consumption, recapitulating key aspects of the Warburg effect. Many tumour cells have elevated rates of glucose uptake but reduced rates of oxidative phosphorylation. This persistence of high lactate production by tumours in the presence of oxygen, known as aerobic glycolysis, was first noted by Otto Warburg more than 75 yr ago1. How tumour cells establish this altered metabolic phenotype and whether it is essential for tumorigenesis is as yet unknown. Here we show that a single switch in a splice isoform of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase is necessary for the shift in cellular metabolism to aerobic glycolysis and that this promotes tumorigenesis. Tumour cells have been shown to express exclusively the embryonic M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase2. Here we use short hairpin RNA to knockdown pyruvate kinase M2 expression in human cancer cell lines and replace it with pyruvate kinase M1. Switching pyruvate kinase expression to the M1 (adult) isoform leads to reversal of the Warburg effect, as judged by reduced lactate production and increased oxygen consumption, and this correlates with a reduced ability to form tumours in nude mouse xenografts. These results demonstrate that M2 expression is necessary for aerobic glycolysis and that this metabolic phenotype provides a selective growth advantage for tumour cells in vivo.},

  ABSTRACT = {The M2 pyruvate kinase (PKM2) isoform is upregulated in most cancers and plays a crucial role in the Warburg effect, which is characterized by the preference for aerobic glycolysis for energy metabolism. PKM2 is an alternative-splice isoform of the PKM gene, and is a potential therapeutic target. Previously, we developed antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that switch PKM splicing from the cancer-associated PKM2 to the PKM1 isoform and induce apoptosis in cultured glioblastoma cells. Here, we explore the potential of ASO-based PKM splice-switching as a targeted therapy for liver cancer. We utilize a lead cEt/DNA ASO, which has a higher potency than MOE modification, to demonstrate that it induces PKM splice-switching and inhibits the growth of cultured hepatocellular-carcinoma (HCC) cells. This PKM isoform switch increases pyruvate-kinase activity and alters glucose metabolism. The lead ASO inhibits tumorigenesis in an orthotopic-xenograft HCC mouse model. Finally, a surrogate mouse-specific ASO induces Pkm splice-switching and inhibits HCC growth, without observable toxicity, in a genetic HCC mouse model. Statement of significance Antisense oligonucleotides are used to force a change in PKM isoform usage in HCC, reversing the Warburg effect and inhibiting tumorigenesis. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement F.R. and C.F.B. are employees of Ionis Pharmaceuticals and own stock options.
