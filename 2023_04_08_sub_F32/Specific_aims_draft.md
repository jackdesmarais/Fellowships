**Specific Aims:**
**Rationale:** Splicing is a process where Pre-mRNAs are processed to remove introns, non-coding segments, and exons, coding segments, are stitched together. More than 90% of human genes are alternatively spliced to produce different sets of exons in different conditions, such at different developmental stages or across cell types \cite{Wang2008-ej}. Given this, it is perhaps unsurprising that aberrant splicing has been implicated in a wide variety of human diseases including Familial Dysautonomia, Early onset Parkinson disease, and cancer \cite{Scotti2015-yp}. While most alternative splicing is believed to act on an individual intron or exon modulating inclusion, exclusion, exon boundaries in a local fashion, recent work has begun to show that correlated splicing is is far more common than previously understood \cite{Zhu2021-fs, Tilgner2015-sb, Hatje2017-oj}. A particularly interesting form of correlated splicing is mutually exclusive exons (MXEs). MXEs are clusters of exons that are spliced such that every isoform includes exactly one exon from the cluster. While in other species clusters of more that 2 MXEs are well known, examples in humans have only recently been detected and have never been extensively charecterized \cite{Jin2018-tq, Hatje2017-oj}. A recent analysis of human RNA-seq data identified 629 MXE clusters, of these a known mechanism of enforcing mutual exclusivity could be detected in less than 25% \cite{Hatje2017-oj}. A lot of progress has been made using massively parallel experiments to probe the mechanisms of splicing \cite{Ke2018-af, Julien2016-wa, Adamson2018-va, Soemedi2017-pz, Cortes-Lopez2022-gy, Schirman2021-ss, Mikl2019-ng, Braun2018-mb, Soucek2019-iq, Baeza-Centurion2020-tn, Cheung2019-ah, Baeza-Centurion2019-hz, Rosenberg2015-zs, Wong2018-vq}. However, existing version of these techniques have not been well suited to the problem of identifying the mechanisms of mutual exclusivity in MXE clusters. **I propose to develop a massively parallel splicing assay for characterizing mechanisms of mutual exclusivity in splicing and apply it to investigating new mechanisms of mutual exclusivity in human splicing.**

**Aim 1: To characterize the mechanism for mutual exclusivity in Pyruvate Kinase M (PKM) exons 9 and 10.** 
*sub-aim 1.1: Developing a screen that is able to detect deviations from mutual exclusivity* We will use next-generation sequencing technologies that are capable of sequencing the entire minigene to measure the effects of mutations in the context of varying the inclusion ratios of the relevant MXEs using advances in splice modifying drugs.
*sub-aim 1.2: Identifying sequence elements necessary for mutual exclusivity in PKM splicing.* To identify the sequence elements responsible for maintaining the trade off between exons 9 and 10, we propose to perform a mutant screen looking for mutations that break the anti-correlation between exon 9 and 10 across a range of ratios of exon inclusion. 
*sub-aim 1.3: Mechanistically characterize sequence elements enforcing mutual exclusivity.* We will follow up these experiments with mechanistic studies of the sequence elements that enforce mutual exclusivity. In many arthropods and the human ATE1 gene \cite{Graveley2005-oi, Jin2018-tq, Kalinina2021-jt} MXEs are enforced by RNA secondary structural elements. We hypothesize that this will be the case in PKM as well. If our analysis suggests that this is the case, we will use mutant cycle analysis to show the importance of the secondary structural elements. 

**Aim 2: To identify the mechanisms responsible for mutual exclusivity in large human MXE clusters.**
