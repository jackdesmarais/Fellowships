  abstract = "Cyanobacteria rely on CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) to grow
              in today's atmosphere (0.04\% CO2). These complex physiological
              adaptations require $\approx$15 genes to produce two types of
              protein complexes: inorganic carbon (Ci) transporters and 100+ nm
              carboxysome compartments that encapsulate rubisco with a carbonic
              anhydrase (CA) enzyme. Mutations disrupting any of these genes
              prohibit growth in ambient air. If any plausible ancestral
              form---i.e., lacking a single gene---cannot grow, how did the CCM
              evolve? Here, we test the hypothesis that evolution of the
              bacterial CCM was ``catalyzed'' by historically high CO2 levels
              that decreased over geologic time. Using an E. coli
              reconstitution of a bacterial CCM, we constructed strains lacking
              one or more CCM components and evaluated their growth across CO2
              concentrations. We expected these experiments to demonstrate the
              importance of the carboxysome. Instead, we found that partial
              CCMs expressing CA or Ci uptake genes grew better than controls
              in intermediate CO2 levels ($\approx$1\%) and observed similar
              phenotypes in two autotrophic bacteria, Halothiobacillus
              neapolitanus and Cupriavidus necator. To understand how CA and Ci
              uptake improve growth, we model autotrophy as colimited by CO2
              and HCO3−, as both are required to produce biomass. Our
              experiments and model delineated a viable trajectory for CCM
              evolution where decreasing atmospheric CO2 induces an HCO3−
              deficiency that is alleviated by acquisition of CA or Ci uptake,
              thereby enabling the emergence of a modern CCM. This work

               molecule, but long reaction times hamper their detection
               sensitivity and speed. Here, we show that unrelated CRISPR

               sensing and rapid signal generation, thus enabling robust
               detection of ~30 molecules per µl of RNA in 20 min. Combining

              decreasing from high concentrations over the last $\approx$3.5
              billion years. We used a synthetic reconstitution of a bacterial
              CCM in E. coli to study the co-evolution of CCMs with atmospheric

              Partial forms expressing CA or Ci uptake genes grew better than
              controls in intermediate CO2 levels ($\approx$ 1\%); we observed
              similar phenotypes in genetic studies of two autotrophic
              bacteria, H. neapolitanus and C. necator. To explain how partial
              CCMs improve growth, we advance a model of co-limitation of
              autotrophic growth by CO2 and HCO3-, as both are required to
              produce biomass. Our model and results delineated a viable
              trajectory for bacterial CCM evolution where decreasing
