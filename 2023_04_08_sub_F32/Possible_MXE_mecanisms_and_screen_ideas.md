## Mechanisms and screens
1. 5'-ss and BP steric hindrance
	1. Vary distance in intron
2. RNA secondary structures
	1. Random mutations and look for any predicted secondary structure changes...
3. Reciprocal regulation
	1. Random mutation changes and look for broken correlation
4. NMD
	1. We can try to remove start codons to stop NMD from playing a role
5. Other things??

## Separate screen ideas
1. Perform the screen in proliferating and differentiated cells to see how the effects change as you switch the default splicing pattern
2. Perform screen in glioblastoma background as there is a mix of both isoforms so might be primed to go both ways
