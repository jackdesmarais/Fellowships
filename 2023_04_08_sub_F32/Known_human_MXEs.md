1.  tropomyosin
2.  Î±-actinin
3.  ketohexokinase
4. fibroblast growth factor receptor 2
5. PKM
	1. PKM1 is present in most differentiated cells
	2. PKM2 is present in most cell lines and proliferating cells
	3. U-118MG and A-172 glioblastoma cell lines still express PKM1 (maybe a good choice for library experiments?)
		1. Also SK-N-BE which splices the RNA both ways but seems to only express PKM1 anyway
	2. proliferating mouse C2C12 myoblasts induced to terminally differentiate into myotubes should switch isoform expression
		1. May allow measurement of how variants affect regulation during differentiation
