# Draft

In my ideal future I will be leading a lab that focuses on using high-throughput techniques and computational methods to address biological problems. I see the value of biology deriving from both the ability to pursue fundamental questions and to see the answer to those questions make a difference in the lives of people. Because of this, I aim to work in a location like a university or a research institute where I can work on a problem from both the fundamental and the applied side. In order to actualize these long term goals, I will be working on a series of shorter term goals during my time as a postdoctoral researcher in the Kinney Lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The first of these goals is to build my expertise in a new field. During my Ph.D. I explored applications of high-throughput screens and computational modeling in Microbiology, Medical Diagnostics, and Protein Engineering. During my postdoc, I hope to strengthen my mastery of these techniques by practicing them in a new context while learning how the splicing of genes is regulated and how this regulation goes awry in cancer. I hope that by building my expertise in this new field I will both improve my ability to become a lab head and help me to shift my research towards a field where the there is a lot of opportunity to work on fundamental problems with real world applications. Splicing is the perfect field to balance these two objectives, because while a lot is known about the essential components required to regulate the splicing of genes, the fundamental question of how these regulators interact to precisely tune the outcomes of splicing is far from understood but despite this, splicing is hugely important to a wide array of human diseases, including cancer, and treatments that address these diseases by modulating splicing are fast becoming a reality. Further, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is the perfect place to dig into these issues with the expertise of  the Kinney Lab on high-throughput screens and computational modeling, the deep knowledge of the Krainer lab on the mechanics of splicing, and the wider environment of the cancer center to provide context and focus.
