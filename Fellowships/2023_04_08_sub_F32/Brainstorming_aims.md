1. Aims
	1. Long-read MPSA and analysis pipeline
	2. Biological application
		1. MXE in cancer relevant genes
		2. Sequence determinants of small molecule splicing drug efficacy
			1. long distance effects on hill coefficient
			2. integration of 5' and 3' splice site strengths
			3.  Small molecule driven intron retention
			4. New 5' library but aimed at doing drug titrations
		3. Use drug titration to cause defined changes in 5'-ss U1 binding energy and look at how this affects splicing processes
			1. MXEs
			2. Cryptic site competition
			3. in connection with a 3'-ss library
			4. Use faster library production techniques to test the 5'-ss library with drug titration across different contexts to look for context effects
			5. We can distinguish cryptic 5'-ss activation
			6. We have protocols worked out, but no one has done it
			7. Mutations seem to be able to change hill coeficient, activate cryptic sites, and change maximal activation. so there is a lot of new biology here
				1. What caused the hill coeficient > 1?
				2. Are there mutants that change hill coeficient?
					1. Certain u6 site mutations maybe?
					2. Can we purposefully separate u1 and u6 binding sites and mutagenize them separately?
					3. Random mutagenesis and look for altered hill coeficient?
			9. Illumina junction sequencing can't get cryptic sites deep in big introns, confidently assess intron retention, or handle MXE. But Illumina junction sequencing is a good backup for if the long reads fail, and allows much deeper sequencing.
