## Summary
1. Splicing switches from PKM1 to PKM2 in cancer/proliferating cells
	1. Important for the warburg effect
	2. Slows glycolysis allowing more anabolic metabolism
2. Isoforms differ by exchanging E9 (PKM1) and E10 (PKM2)
	1. exons are highly homologous
3. Using differentiating cell models, you can watch the switch happen
4. Some cell lines (mostly neuronal have some of both isoforms)
5. ASOs and spliceing factor KDs can shift splicing patterns
	1. Usually leads to a mixture of exon switching and double skipping but primarily Exon switching not skipping
6. SRSF3 is important for activating E10
	1. Altering SRSF3 regulation can drive isoform switching
	2. It is unclear if this also causes some amount of double skipping or double inclusion because of issues with the relevant minigene [[Wang_et_al-2012-Exon-centric_regulation_of_pyruvate_kinase_M_alternative_splicing_via_mutually_exclusive_exons|Wang et al. 2012 mol cell bio]]
7. There is at least one other non SRSF3 motif that is capable of driving E10 down (and E9 up) when blocked with an ASO
