# Thawing a HeLa cell stock

## Objective
Revive a cell stock from FBS+DMSO in LN2 of HeLa cells to grow

## Steps
1. Gather reagents
	1. Warm DMEM+10%FBS to RT
	2. 2 1.5 cm dishes
	3. A 15 ml conical
	4. A bucket of Dry Ice
2. Find a cell stock
	1. Go to the hillside ice cube
	2. Our box is in rack F the dark blue box
3. Remove stock to dry ice bucket
4. Swirl aliquot in 37c water until thawed
5. add 1 ml media to tube
	1. Gently mix - no bubbles
6. Transfer media to 15 ml conical
7. spin down 5 min 300xg 4C
8. Aspirate off media with glass pastur pipette
	1. It's OK to leave a bit at the bottom
9. Gently resuspend the cells in 4 ml media
	1. resuspend by pipetting gently - no bubbles
10. Add 2 ml cells to each dish
11. Check the cells on the microscope
	1. Should be dilute and rounded
12. Put at 37c for 48 hours
13. Continue to split and scale the cells for several splits until they are growing robustly and consistently
