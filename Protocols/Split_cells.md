# Split cells

## Objective
Regrow cells when they are at high confluence or regrow cells at a different scale

## Steps
1. Gather reagents
	1. Warm 1xPBS to RT
	2. Warm DMEM+10%FBS to RT
	3. Warm 1x Trypsin to RT
2. Etoh all reagents and bring into biohood
3. Take a plate of cells and check confluence on the microscope
	1. Observe under the microscope with the red objective
	2. Estimate what fraction of the field of view is covered by adhered cells for several fields of view (confluence)
	3. Look for dead cells small floating cells in the media
4. Aspirate off the media with a glass pastur pipette
5. Rinse plate with PBS (~50% media volume)
6. Add trypsin
	1. 3 ml for a 15 ml plate
	2. 1 ml for a 10 ml plate
7. Incubate at 37 for 3-5 min until you can see cells detatching
8. During incubation prep a new plate by adding media
	1. Add ~2ml total media for a 1.5 cm plate
	2. Add ~10 ml total media for a 10 cm plate
	3. Add ~24 ml total for a 15 cm plate
9. Wash the cells off the old plate with new media
	1. The new media should get turbid
	2. ~10 ml is a good amount for a 15 cm plate
	3. Pipette 8-10 x to break up cells so you can get an accurate cell count if you will be counting the cells
10. Transfer some media from the old plate to the new plate
	1. Estimate the proper back dilution to get the new volume
11. Wiggle the new media back and forth to disperse the new cells
	1. Side-to-side and up-and-down motions not circles to avoid gathering all the cells to the center
12. Image the new plate on the microscope, cells should be spaced out and rounded up to show that they are dilute and unattached
13. Place the new plate in the incubator
14. aspirate off the old media
15. Clean up and etoh the hood and the aspirator
16. turn on the UV
