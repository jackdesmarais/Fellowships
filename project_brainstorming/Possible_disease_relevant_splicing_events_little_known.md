1.  FAR1 SNPs in exon 9a cause RCDP but novel exon 9b is expressed at much lower levels. Driving up inclusion may be a potential treatment
	1. [[Hatje_et_al-2017-The_landscape_of_human_mutually_exclusive_splicing|Hatje et al 2017]]
	2. Since this is a new exon, maybe there is operunity to be the first here??
2. [[msb177728-sup-0008-dataset_ev7.xls]] Contains diseasse associations of SNPs in MXEs and relative expression of exons in HeLa cells
	1. Possibly a good resource to select interesting targets
	2. Identifying targets where you expect to see multiple isoforms in HeLa will set us up to have an easy experiment maybe?
3. CUX1 seems to have implications for cancer as well as a variety of other possible phenotypes in a broad array of other processes
	1. Also has a circ-RNA it forms that might be important
