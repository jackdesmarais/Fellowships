# Draft

My research project proposes to use High throughput screens and computational modeling to help understand how the splicing of mutually exclusive exons is isregulated in cancer. I have extensive experience with performing both high throughput screens and modeling from the work in my Ph.D. During this work, I used high throughput screens to identify essential genes and genes involved in the CO$_{2}$ concentrating mechanism in a chemoautotroph. Further I used a mixture of high throughput screens and modeling to map the fitness landscape of dihydrofolate reductase and generate highly divergent functional variants. I also applied kinetic modeling to the design cas13 based diagnostics with nuclease dependent signal amplification for use as in diagnostics for RNA viruses. These projects have built my skills with high throughput screens setting me up well to design and perform screens to identify and characterize splicing regulatory sequences. Further these projects have sharpened my skills with modeling preparing me to create computational models based on our screening data to both inform our understanding of the underlying processes and predict the outcome of perturbations, such as potential interventions. Additionally, I have taken courses directly applicable to the work I will be performing. During my Ph.D. I took the graduate level course "Fundamentals of Molecular and Cell Biology" which had a unit covering splicing, and many sections that touched on different aspects of cancer biology. Further, I took the upper division seminar "The Genetics of Cancer" during my undergraduate which included a deep dive into how regulation goes astray to cause cancer as well as a lab component that included work with cancer cell lines. These courses will provide a firm base for my work on splicing in cancer and for the cell culture techniques I will need to perform screens in human cells. I also took a wide array of biology and computer science courses in my undergraduate as part of my molecular biology and biochemistry major and my computer science minor that will provide base knowledge for my work. Finally, if project ends up requiring confirmatory experiments in mouse models, I have ample experience with mouse work from my time studying mouse spermatogenesis in the Ward lab in undergraduate (2014 & 2015) and my time studying mouse photopiment expression in the Neitz lab while I was in high school (2011 & 2012).
