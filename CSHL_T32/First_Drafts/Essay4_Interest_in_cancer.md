# Draft

One aspect of cancer research that I find particularly interesting is studying how the regulation of processes is altered in the context of cancer. These alterations provide a window into how these processes are regulated by demonstrating how this regulation can be disrupted. This allows insight into the underlying biological processes furthermore, since these insights are generated in the context of differences between cancer cells and healthy cells, there can be opportunities to apply what is learned to helping patients. In particular, I find the differential regulation of splicing in the cancer interesting. Most human multi-exon genes are differentially spliced,[^cite] and the regulation of these splicing events can differ in cancer.[^Christofk2008-bu] [^Li2016-kt] Moreover these changes in splicing are important for disease progression.[^Christofk2008-bu] [^Li2016-kt] While splice modifying drugs are are starting to be used to treat genetic disease,[^cite] there is still a lot that is not known about how splicing is regulated. Understanding how the sequence of the pre-mRNA drives differences in splicing and how cancers cells change these patterns to drive disease offers the potential to both learn fascinating fundamental biology and to learn how these changes can be disrupted to treat disease. In addition to satisfying my curiosity and providing windows into possible treatments for cancer, studying these aspects of cancer biology will help me develop a career as an independent cancer researcher by allowing me to explore applications of my expertise in high throughput screening and computational modeling in cancer research. Through this exploration, I can begin to build the research plan that will form the core of an independent research group in the future. Additionally, it will allow me to strengthen my experience with splicing, cancer genetics, and cell culture. Further building these skills will help me create a strong foundation for continuing to research splicing in cancer in the future. Finally, by working in the environment of the cancer center at CSHL surrounded by deep expertise on a wide array of topics in cancer, I can build an intuition for the open questions in cancer and splicing that will form the heart of a successful independent cancer research career.
